# ANA-505-Week-6-Activity-
These scripts focuses on running three algorithms SVM(Support Vector Machine), K-means, and C50 in R programming language.

## SVM(Support Vector Machine) Algorithm:

SVM(Support Vector Machine) algorithm learns a hyperplane to classify data into the classes. This algorithm projects data into higher dimensions and figures out the the hyperplane which classify data into different classes. This is a supervised machine learning method.

The script uses iris dataset to apply SVM model in order to predict species. Radial kernel is used for developing SVM model in the script. 


#### SVM accuracy: 97.33333%

## K-Means Clustering Algorithm:

K-means creates groups from set of objects such that members of groups are more similar. This is an unsupervised machine learning method.

The script uses iris dataset to apply K-means model in order to predict species. The attributes are normalized between 0 and 1. These normalized attributes are used in K-means clustering algorithm in order to develop 3 clusters. 


#### K-Means accuracy: 88.66667%

## C50 Algorithm:

C50 algorithm constructs classifier in terms of decision tree. This is a supervised machine learning method.

The script uses iris dataset to apply C50 algorithm in order to predict species.

#### C50 accuracy: 93.3%
